        <p class="mb3">Dear Ms. Vincent,</p>
        <p class="mb3">
          We’re Theo, Luke, and Saharsh—three Westborough High School school students who have been closely watching the district build its plan for the upcoming school year and were increasingly concerned that the student body wouldn’t have a voice.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          <strong>So, last Monday, <a href="/" target="_blank">we released a poll</a> asking middle school and high school students what they thought of the plan.</strong> After collecting 143 voluntary responses from students, we crunched the numbers. Students were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with 8 statements on a scale of 1 to 5.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          We used a “statistical inference test,” which is where we draw a conclusion (i.e: the majority of students believe x) based on what students think about each question. We considered >50% a majority. We’ve also attached the raw data (with student names anonymized) below in case you’d like to take a look.
        </p>
        <p class="mb2">
          One-hundred and forty-three students responded to the poll—here’s what
          they think:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb1"><strong>
            Students are unsure whether they feel comfortable going to school
            2-3 days a week.</strong>
          </li>
          <li class="mb1">
            A majority of students are against any plan that involves going to
            school 5 days a week.
          </li>
          <li class="mb1">
            A majority of students are OK with some implementation of going to
            school in-person.
          </li>
          <li class="mb1">
            A majority of students would feel comfortable if there were more
            than two groups (Navy & Cardinal) of students
          </li>
          <li class="mb1">
            <strong>A majority of students would prefer to go to school for two days in
            a row, then take two days off instead of going every other day</strong>
          </li>
          <li class="mb1">
            A majority of students are comfortable having 9-12 peers in their
            classroom
          </li>
          <li class="mb1">
            <strong>A majority of students aren’t comfortable with having 7 hours a day
            (high school) & 5 hours a day (middle school) of work on non-school
            days</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Our recommendation (based on the data) would be to lower this number. This is a stressful time, and students should be able to use their days off to decompress as well as complete work.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="mb3">
            A majority of students are comfortable with being taught by a mix of
            teacher from Westborough & neighboring towns online.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb2">
          <strong>Eight students also provided written responses (attached). We’ve
          attached some highlights below:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
          “as much as it saddens me to say it, I have to. it isn't going to
          work, one missed COVID case will turn into hundreds in a matter of
          weeks. I cannot imagine a scenario that is completely air-tight, it
          can never be. it simply will not work, and not particularly worried
          about myself rather than the teachers that see many kids in one day
          and those who have to clean the building frequently. they are at risk
          and I do not want to be part of the problem.”
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          “I noticed that one of the statements in the poll was "I would prefer
          going to school in-person for two days, then taking two days
          off—rather than going every other day.” and I completely agree with
          it. As a student, I would feel much more comfortable going into school
          the second day in a week knowing that there wouldn’t have been the
          entire other half of the school (for WHS, some 500-600 people!) that
          would have walked the same halls and sat in the same desks. I feel
          that we could also get more learning done this way. It is a longer
          time to see teachers between blocks, but there isn’t an interruption
          after every day which might end up being a greater disruption. Two day
          blocks would be particularly helpful for the labs and projects in
          science and science-related classes, as well as any group projects in
          any class. Additionally, instead of how Fridays are currently set up,
          I think that it could be added to the two day block of Wednesday and
          Thursday to further minimize risk as the same students will be passing
          through school for three days at a time. Of course, all this is
          mentioned considering that I would rather be taught by Westborough
          teachers live remotely. However, that is not the current remote plan,
          so while I dislike the hybrid plan, to me it is the least bad of the
          choices which are all unpalatable.”
