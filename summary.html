          The school explored three back-to-school models: a full return, a
          hybrid return (partial in school, partial out of school), and a fully
          remote return.

            >The district made the decision to move forward with the hybrid plan
            because they think that it's important for students to see each
            other & their teachers in-person.</b

          They acknowledge that it's possible transmission rates will increase &
          they will have to return to a fully-remote model.
